## Twitter Images List

Have you ever dreamed of a tool capable of collecting all the photos of cats posted on Twitter by Internet users from all over the world?

![Yes I do!](.docs/cat.jpg)

Well this project is for you, and it consists of three modules.
First of all, if you don't already have one created, create a new GCP project [here](https://console.cloud.google.com), and turn the billing on.
Then follow the docs to get up and running.

Note: when copy pasting parts of this docs, you will need to replace every occurences of `$PROJECT_ID` by your GCP project id.

Ready? Then git clone this repository locally, and get through the installation detail for each of the three components.
